# Hotel Cancellation Analysis

## Overview 
This repository contains the code and resources for the Hotel Cancellation Analysis project. The objective of this project was to utilize machine learning techniques and other technologies to analyze various attributes of customers' hotel booking details and create a model capable of predicting whether the booking will be cancelled or not, considering different features.

## Project Details
- **Topic:** Hotel Cancellation Analysis
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PySpark, TensorFlow
- **Data Source:** INN Hotels Group dataset from Kaggle
- **Team Collaboration:** The project was a collaborative effort involving four team members:
  - Brad Fisher
  - Sameer Erande
  - Rhea Pius
  - Puja Tiwari

## Features
The project includes the following features:

- **Data Collection:** Data was collected from the INN Hotels Group dataset, which contains information about hotel bookings in Portugal.
- **Data Processing:** Python libraries such as Pandas and PySpark were used for data cleaning, normalization, and standardization.
- **Modeling:** Various machine learning models were experimented with, including TensorFlow neural network, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- **Visualizations:** Visualizations were created to explore the relationships between different features and cancellation rates.

## Repository Structure
- **data/:** Contains the dataset files obtained from Kaggle.
- **notebooks/:** Includes Jupyter Notebook files containing the data processing and modeling code.
- **results/:** Stores the visualizations generated by Tableau
- **README.md:** Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the tools and libraries used.


### Usage Guide:

#### Setting up Spark Environment:

1. **Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install Spark and Java by executing the provided commands in your terminal.

2. **Start a SparkSession:**
   - Import the required packages.
   - Create a SparkSession using `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.appName()`.

#### Importing and Preprocessing Data:

3. **Import CSV File and Load Data into Spark DataFrame:**
   - Use PySpark to import the CSV file and load the data into a Spark DataFrame.

4. **Examine Important Features Impacting Booking Status/Cancellations:**
   - Convert the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame for data cleaning.
   - Perform data cleaning steps such as converting columns to numeric values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Explore important features impacting booking status or cancellations using Random Forest model and visualize feature importance.

5. **Create a New DataFrame with Features/Columns with the Most Impact:**
   - Make a copy of the original DataFrame.
   - Clean the data by dropping unnecessary columns and encoding categorical variables.
   - Prepare the data for machine learning models.

#### Building Machine Learning Models:

6. **TensorFlow Model:**
   - Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays.
   - Scale the data and define the structure of the neural network model.
   - Compile and train the TensorFlow model.
   - Evaluate the model using the test data.

7. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Instantiate a Logistic Regression model and fit it using the training data.
   - Make predictions and evaluate the model using test data.
   - Display the balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

8. **Random Forest Model:**
   - Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays.
   - Fit a Random Forest classifier to the training data.
   - Make predictions and evaluate the model using test data.
   - Display the feature importances, confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.

### Visualization with Tableau:

9. **Use Tableau for Visualization:**
   - Utilize Tableau for visualization by exporting the data or connecting directly to the dataset.


## Ethical Considerations
In conducting our hotel cancellation analysis, ethical considerations were paramount. We handled customer data with sensitivity and respect for privacy. No personally identifiable information was used or shared during the analysis. Our focus was solely on understanding patterns and trends in hotel booking data to improve industry practices.
